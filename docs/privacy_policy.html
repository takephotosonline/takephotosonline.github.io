                <p>It is Takephotos.online's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect
                    while operating our Service. This Privacy Policy applies to
                    <a href="https://takephotos.online">https://takephotos.online</a>
                    and all the subdomains like https://app.takephotos.online, etc
                    (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "https://takephotos.online"). We respect your privacy and are committed
                    to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have
                    adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our
                    Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information
                    to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and
                    does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.</p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms of service posted on our Website, set forth the general
                    rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our
                    Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms of service.</p>

                <h2>Service Visitors</h2>
                <p>Like most website operators, Takephotos.online collects non-personally-identifying information of the
                    sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
                    preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Takephotos.online's
                    purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how
                    Takephotos.online's visitors use its website. From time to time, Takephotos.online may release
                    non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in
                    the usage of its website.</p>
                <p>Takephotos.online also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol
                    (IP) addresses of connected users.</p>

                <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
                <p>We care about your privacy. We limit the personally-identifying information to absolute minimum.
                    The amount and type of
                    information that Takephotos.online gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we
                    ask visitors who sign up for a Service access token to provide an email
                    address to send back the requested access token.
<!--                    This email address could not be associated with any real user name, IP adress or any-->
<!--                    potentially sensitive data.-->
                </p>

<!--                    Certain visitors to Takephotos.online's websites choose to interact with Takephotos.online in ways-->
<!--                    that require Takephotos.online to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of-->
<!--                    information that Takephotos.online gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we-->
<!--                    ask visitors who sign up for a blog at https://takephotos.online to provide a username and email-->
<!--                    address.</p>-->

                <h2>Security</h2>
                <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of
                    transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to
                    use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its
                    absolute security.</p>

                <h2>Advertisements</h2>
                <p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.
                    These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online
                    advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information
                    allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be
                    of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Takephotos.online and does
                    not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

                <h2>Links To External Sites</h2>
                <p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third
                    party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the
                    Privacy Policy and terms of service of every site you visit.</p>
                <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices
                    of any third party sites, products or services.</p>


                <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
                <p>Takephotos.online discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information
                    only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
                    information in order to process it on Takephotos.online's behalf or to provide services available at
                    Takephotos.online's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those
                    employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by
                    using Takephotos.online's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
                    Takephotos.online will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and
                    personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and
                    affiliated organizations, as described above, Takephotos.online discloses potentially
                    personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court
                    order or other governmental request, or when Takephotos.online believes in good faith that
                    disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Takephotos.online, third
                    parties or the public at large.</p>
                <p>If you are a user of https://takephotos.online and have supplied your email address,
                    Takephotos.online may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your
                    feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Takephotos.online and our products.
                    We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of
                    email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our
                    feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to
                    your request or to help us support other users. Takephotos.online takes all measures reasonably
                    necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
                    personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

                <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
                <p>Takephotos.online may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website.
                    Takephotos.online may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However,
                    Takephotos.online does not disclose your personally-identifying information.</p>


                <h2>Cookies</h2>
                <p>To enrich and perfect your online experience, Takephotos.online uses "Cookies", similar technologies
                    and services provided by others to display personalized content, appropriate advertising and store
                    your preferences on your computer.</p>
                <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the
