                    supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its
                    essential purpose.</p>
                <p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for
                    incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply.
                    In these states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>

                <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on

                    may not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section
                    shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.</p>
